---------------

Binary search divide by 2

The algorithm Jon used, linear search, 
seemed familiar to us and you could understand 
it because it's how most of us search for things in real life anyway. Brittney's 
approach on the other hand got results quickly but was a bit harder to understand 
so let's break it down.

Algorithm
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
- The steps also need to be distinct
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount  of time
