# Recursion and space complexity
call function -> Recursive depth

2 way measuring the effiency runtime algorithm

# Time complexity
- Time complexity is runtime complexity grows and grows logic.

# Space complexity
- Space complexity is a measure if how much working storage, or extra storage, is needed as a particular
algorithm grows.
- Memory used
- Worse case scenario

Space complexity of old binary search = N

Space complexity of Recursive binary search = N, N/2, N/4 O(log n)

Recap

Why we learn ?

Algorithmic Thinking
- Problem solving
- Did everyday
- know binary search how to search faster
- know how to sort data which unsorted

Big O
- Time complexity, gold is how to understand evaluate algorithm
- we learn runtime Constant, Linear, Logarithmic, Quadratic
- Linear search, Binary search

Recursion
- Recursive binary search
